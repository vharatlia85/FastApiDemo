FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and highly efficient, making it a popular choice for both beginner and expert developers.

### Key Features:
1. **Speed:** As its name suggests, FastAPI is designed for high performance. It's one of the fastest Python frameworks available, largely thanks to its use of asynchronous programming.
2. **Easy to Use:** FastAPI is known for its ease of use. It has a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to write clean and readable code.
3. **Automatic Documentation:** FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc) which makes it easy to test and explore your API endpoints.
4. **Data Validation:** With FastAPI, you get automatic validation and conversion of request data using Pydantic models.
5. **Dependency Injection:** FastAPI has a built-in dependency injection system, which makes it easy to manage dependencies in a clean and modular way.
6. **Type Annotations:** FastAPI uses standard Python type hints to provide more readable and manageable code, which helps prevent bugs and improves developer productivity.

### Example:
Here's a simple example of how to create a basic FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

To run the FastAPI app, save the code in a file (e.g., `main.py`), and use Uvicorn to serve it:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, and you'll see the message "Hello World". You can also explore the automatically generated documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

FastAPI is great for building web APIs quickly and efficiently, and it's used by many companies and developers around the world.
